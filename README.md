Specific subjects proposed (not complete, please fill in):

## Security Topics

(Carsten Bormann:)

* Secure Discovery — Security Objectives and how to get there

(Christian Amsüss:) I'd like to propose my two current documents:

* <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-amsuess-t2trg-onion-coap/>

  with the intention to gather feedback and rally people to actually
  run the experiment

* <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-amsuess-t2trg-raytime/>

  as a short intro, with the questions of "does this fit here" and
  "where (else) was this already (almost) done"?

(Active documents:)

* <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-t2trg-security-setup-iot-devices/>
* <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-t2trg-taxonomy-manufacturer-anchors/>
* <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-t2trg-amplification-attacks/>

## Non-IP Cluster

* Naming and Identity in <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-amsuess-core-coap-over-gatt/>

(Eliot Lear:) \[not in first slot]

* OSS for both SCIM and the forthcoming non-IP control (NIPC)
